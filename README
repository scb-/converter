Python Doc LaTeX to Sphinx converter
====================================

This converter was used to convert the Python docs to Sphinx'
reStructuredText format. It can also be used to convert other
docs using the LaTeX style, with a custom script that directly
calls ``convert_file`` from the converter package. The only
thing you have to be aware of is the include file mapping, which
the converter will consult when it encounters a ``literalinclude``
command.  You can monkey-patch that dictionary like this::

     from converter import restwriter, convert_file

     class IncludeRewrite:
         def get(self, a, b=None):
             if os.path.exists(os.path.join(source, a + '.tex')):
                 return a + '.rst'
             return a
     restwriter.includes_mapping = IncludeRewrite()

     for infile, outfile in <somecollection>:
         convert_file(infile, outfile)
